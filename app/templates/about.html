<p><br>Returning Citizen is a clone of the Buscando project, an open source resource directory to assist Latin American children seeking refuge.
We are working to reformat our data to align with the new human services data specifications, an initiative to develop common standards and open platforms for the sharing of community resource directory data.</p>
